# Resume Delivery Methods: Attachment vs Download Link

## Comparison

| Aspect | Email Attachment | Download Link |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Simple (local file) | ⚠️ Requires cloud storage |
| **Email Size** | ⚠️ Large (PDF in email) | ✅ Small (just URL) |
| **Delivery Speed** | ✅ Instant | ✅ Fast (CDN) |
| **Storage Cost** | ✅ Free (local) | ⚠️ Cloud storage fees |
| **Security** | ⚠️ Less control | ✅ Better (expiring links, access control) |
| **Analytics** | ❌ No tracking | ✅ Track downloads, views |
| **Spam Risk** | ⚠️ Higher (large attachments) | ✅ Lower |
| **Offline Access** | ✅ Yes (in inbox) | ⚠️ Requires internet |
| **File Updates** | ❌ Must resend | ✅ Update file, link stays same |
| **Bandwidth** | ⚠️ High (per email) | ✅ Low (one-time download) |
| **Expiry Control** | ❌ No expiry | ✅ Can expire links |
| **Virus Scanning** | ⚠️ May trigger filters | ✅ Less likely |

## When to Use Each

### Use Email Attachment When:
- ✅ Simple setup is priority
- ✅ Small file size (< 5MB)
- ✅ Low volume (< 100 emails/day)
- ✅ No need for analytics
- ✅ Recipients need offline access

### Use Download Link When:
- ✅ Large file size (> 5MB)
- ✅ High volume sending
- ✅ Need download analytics
- ✅ Want to update resume without resending
- ✅ Need security/expiry control
- ✅ Production/enterprise use

## Recommendation

**Development/Testing:** Use attachment (simpler)
**Production:** Use download link (more professional, scalable)
